# The Automated Cesar  
Advanced Static and Dynamic Binary Analysis for BinNavi

The Automated Cesar is a comprehensive toolkit of static and dynamic binary analysis techniques designed to extend and enhance [Zynamics BinNavi](https://www.zynamics.com/binnavi.html).

## Features
- **Control and Dataflow Analysis**: Classic algorithms for understanding binary execution paths.
- **Abstract Interpretation**: Techniques such as reaching definitions, value propagation, register and range tracking, and value set analysis.
- **Abstract Memory Models**: Support for load/store operations, dynamic memory regions, and stack usage analysis.
- **Diet REIL**: Optimization for the [Reverse Engineering Intermediate Language](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.zynamics.com/en//downloads/csw09-final.pdf), reducing IR size by approximately 65% for complex x86 instructions.
- **Dynamo**: Instrumentation and tracing tools for hybrid analyses combining static and dynamic methods.
